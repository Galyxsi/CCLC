Currently, these are the implemented Varyn in the mod:

Bira
-----
The species closest to our world's humans. They are often very adaptable,
able to do many things, but not often able to master more than one thing at a time.
Many other Varyn of the world dislike Bira due to past conflict, causing many non-Biras
to not enjoy trade with them, or not wanting to make friends with them.

They do have a knack for creativity and creation though, being the most technologically advanced
Varyn around, partially to catch up with the power discrepancy when compared to other Varyn,
and partially because of their natural curiosity in how the world works.
